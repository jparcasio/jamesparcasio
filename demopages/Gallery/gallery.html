        <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one of the new technology trends because its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.</p>
        <p>Other than that AI will be used further to analyze interactions to determine underlying connections and insights, to help predict demand for services like hospitals enabling authorities to make better decisions about resource utilization, and to detect the changing patterns of customer behaviour by analyzing data in near real-time, driving revenues and enhancing personalized experiences.</p>
        <p>The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching over $57 billion in 2021.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!</p>
        <p>Machine Learning the subset of AI, is also being deployed in all kinds of industries, creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. Forrester predicts AI, machine learning, and automation will create 9 percent of new U.S. jobs by 2025, jobs including robot monitoring professionals, data scientists, automation specialists, and content curators, making it another new technology trend you must keep in mind too! However, AI is the new trending technology since 2020 and survey says it will have a great scope in the future!</p>

        <h1>1. Hybrid Is the New Normal</h1>
        <img src="img/Hybrid Is the New Normal.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" alt="1">
        <p>Several industries thrived in this grand experiment in which employees shifted from offices to their homes. However, the preference is really for flexibility, and even in the midst of quarantines and isolation, many companies haven’t fully adopted a work-from-home model. There are essential employees who must be on site and executives who still travel. Some companies have been creative in allowing their workforce to gather in person by setting up outdoor offices.</p>
        <h1>2. Enhanced Immersive Technology</h1>
        <img src="img/Enhanced Immersive Technology.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" alt="2">
        <p>With the advent of 5G technology, more areas across the nation can support remote work and experiential platforms, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Implications for learning include more immediate and immersive experiences; an improved ability to meet employees where they are; and the ability to go deeper with content, environment and virtual “shoulder-to-shoulder” instruction. Zoom fatigue is showing us that video calls are not sufficient, especially when it comes to creating a virtual classroom, and is one reason organizations will increasingly rely on AR and VR.</p>
        <h1>3. Increased Workloads</h1>
        <img src="img/Increased Workloads.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" alt="3">
        <p>In 2021, developing an enterprise-wide digital acumen will prove to be the antidote to some of the continued disruption, such as the increase in workload, broadening of job responsibilities and new skill requirements. Often, disruption isn’t about competition; rather, it comes from within. The same transformation that is creating growth for companies can also provide growth for employees by offering career development, wellness and other benefits to help with the increase in work. Evolving learning programs, in step with broader corporate evolution, can inspire employees, resulting in retention and growth.</p>
        <h1>4. L&D Is Leading the Charge</h1>
        <img src="img/L&D Is Leading the Charge.jpg" width="500px" height="500px" alt="4">
        <p>Learning organizations must adapt along with their workforce to the quickly evolving world, shifting to new areas of demand. Beyond the pandemic, there will be a substantial need for L&D to bring new workers up to speed rapidly and to diversify the skills of existing employees.</p>
        <h1>5. Adapting to Digital Formats</h1>
        <img src="img/Adapting to Digital Formats.jpeg" width="500px" height="500px" alt="5">
        <p>Organizations that were already on the path to digital transformation had a head start last year, but learning departments have the opportunity to take the lead. Tapping into digital platforms is half the battle, and the other is knowing how to learn — not necessarily a given for companies and teams focused on digital transformation without an embedded learning component.</p>
        <p>As innovators know, being agile — experimenting as a way of working — is only successful if learning is built into the process. Moving fast just to move fast doesn’t create value if insights aren’t carried over from one iteration to the next. Therefore, learning isn’t just a department; it is a state of mind and a requirement for continued innovation and success.</p>
        <p>Long-term trends and the nature of the current historical moment point to one conclusion: L&D will be critically important to companies navigating the post-COVID world, where success will hinge largely on the ability to adapt rapidly to unpredictable forces. No one will be able to tell L&D leaders in advance which new programs their companies might need; however, the need will be great, and timelines will be short.</p>
