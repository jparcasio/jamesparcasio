            <h1>DUNOO aka <span>KUYA D</span></h1>
            <p>The DoTa 2 community on Friday mourned the death of famed shoutcaster Aldrin Paulo Pangan -- also known as "Dunoo" and one of the brainchildren behind the "Lakad Matatag" battlecry -- after he passed away due to COVID-19. 

                Dunoo was the other half behind the iconic "Lakad matatag, normalin normalin (Walk steadily and deliver a normal hit)" line first used when he and Marlon "Lon" Marcelo commentated on the match between Fnatic and Team Secret in ESL One Katowice in February 2018. 
                
                European team OG also rallied behind the battlecry when it won The International the same year. National esports team Sibol also adapted the battlecry in its first Southeast Asian Games campaign -- and it was especially prominent when Sibol's DoTa 2 team eked out a come-from-behind victory to take the SEA Games gold medal. </p>
