            <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>James Bryan</span></h1>
            <p>I chose to major in computer science because it affords me the opportunity to explore both of my passions: solving problems and producing creative experiences. Through code, I can generate ideas that solve user-specific problems, design and ideate possible solutions, and then execute them. Ultimately, engaging in this end-to-end experience is fulfilling to me because I get to not only imagine an experience but also bring it to fruition.

                What I enjoy most about the Computer Science Department is the healthy collaboration. In class, professors often encourage us to talk with one another to better our understanding of concepts and solve problems.</p>
